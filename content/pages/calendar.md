**Legislating Clean Air** ({{% resource_link 7add5cae-2b55-ba37-2d9c-55986b8ac269 "PDF 1" %}}) ({{% resource_link d6313041-868f-cf58-73e3-5ee1ec4e87bf "PDF 2" %}})

The government had to do something about America's unbreathable air. And it did: the Clean Air Act of 1970. Congress set air standards, set deadlines, and ordered the air to be cleansed.

This class examines the driving forces behind the rise of environmental legislation that poured out of the Congress beginning in 1970s. The legislative surge in American environmentalism--the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act in particular--ushered in an era of "command and control" regulation setting the stage for political conflict between private enterprise and the public interest.

**Commanding Clean Water** ({{% resource_link 787bb629-9b8d-96f1-ff5d-d011607b76b6 "PDF" %}})

The Clean Water Act of 1972 was supposed to make all the waters of the U.S. clean by 1985. What happened and why?

Congress, concerned that government environmental agencies might become "captive" of the very industries they were supposed to monitor and regulate, put citizen enforcement provisions in the Clean Water Act. Quickly, environmental litigators and the courts became major players in environmental policy.

**The Slippery Slope of Environmental Protection: The Case of Wetlands** ({{% resource_link b8f3c6f7-ef52-e86b-9bb4-e3e7bdfdcd7c "PDF" %}})

This class explores how the reach of a law can expand beyond what its original creators intended. We look at how a series of court cases broadened the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act and forced the US Army Corps of Engineers to protect wetlands--and then two decades later forced it to "unprotect" them.

**Endangered Species and Biodiversity** ({{% resource_link e1a73c3a-6b09-e861-7e87-cc478d1cd06e "PDF" %}})

Americans have always had a schizophrenic "environmental" attitude toward wildlife and the landscape. An unstable mix of values:--romanticism, utilitarianism, dominionism (fear), and liberty (common property ownership)--has made preservation and protection of America's natural landscape a policy rife with internal contradictions, reversals, and too-little too-late reactions.

The Endangered Species Act (1973) suggests that American policy-makers were prepared to make tough decisions favoring biodiversity over the economy. Was this true? And if so, how do we explain it?

We also explore the role of the courts in environmental policy making.

**Of Toxic Wastes and Government Failure** ({{% resource_link 8521f837-c880-5820-86b1-145da1ca82fd "PDF" %}})

This lecture examines how mass politics extended the environmental mandate, bringing about stringent regulations and standards for hazardous waste control. What mobilizes public participation in environmental policy and how does that participation affect policy? How does the public grapple with complex scientific and technical issues? How do government and media organizations respond to public pressures?

**The Reagan Revolution: Rethinking Environmental Policy** ({{% resource_link 1c6b9c03-00e3-273f-0a6d-95ec377b4868 "PDF" %}})

The Reagan administration comes to power critical of "big government" in general and government regulation in particular--especially environmental regulation. Arguing that environmental regulation was hobbling the economy the administration tried to dismantle the environmental framework that had been established the previous decade. One of its more lasting efforts was to require cost-benefit analysis for environmental regulations.

General dissatisfaction with big government and the seeming stagnation of environmental policy opens the door for advocates of economic mechanisms to guide environmental policy choices. Markets, taxes, subsidies, etc. can be employed to elicit voluntary environmentalism.

**Environmental Equity and Justice** ({{% resource_link 138783f0-dd0d-5649-4fd6-43943c7dde38 "PDF" %}})

There can be no doubt that 30 years of environmental policy has lessened the pollution burden on the nation, slowed the loss of ecological communities and species, and improved our quality of life. But not all Americans have benefited equally. Some Americans--minorities and the poor, in particular--may have enjoyed no benefit at all. Is this "unfair" distribution of environmental benefits just an artifact of policy or does it reflect racial and class biases in our society?

**Environmental Protection and Wise Use of Public Lands** ({{% resource_link 5a826f7b-64a1-6a80-9de1-2daf989c2541 "PDF" %}})

This lecture explores the rise of anti-environmentalism in the western revolt against federal control of public lands and its spill over to environmental policy in the rest of the country. It investigates relationships among the Presidency, Congress, federal agencies, and interest groups and how those relationships determine public lands policy.

Focus on the collision between public and private interests and values.

**Community-Based Environmental Protection**

To this point our discussions have looked at environmental policy as conceived and implemented by national and state governments. Some argue that the "next wave" of progress in environmental policy will be place-based local environmentalism.

**Comparing Environment Policymaking Around the World** ({{% resource_link 58d2e75b-0039-1de5-2c05-3c77b1545553 "PDF" %}})

For the past few months we have looked at how institutions, interest groups, elected officials, etc. define and shape solutions to US environmental problems. In this lecture we look briefly at other countries and their experience with acid rain. We consider whether different political institutions result in different outcomes, or if cultural, economic, or demographic factors are more important for explaining differences among national environmental policies.

**Energy and the Environment** ({{% resource_link 0b69ee28-2970-0214-3449-b87a52c01255 "PDF" %}})

Cheap energy drives the American economy; indeed, it drives the global economy. But cheap energy carries a heavy environmental price tag. Extracting fossil fuels despoils the landscape. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. Hydropower devastates river ecology, while nuclear power leaves deadly wastes behind. How do we decide these tradeoffs?
